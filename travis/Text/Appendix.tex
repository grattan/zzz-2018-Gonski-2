\chapter{Potential new initiatives in the federal Government's 2016 schools strategy}\label{chap:New_initiatives_quality_schools}

The list below is our interpretation of  potential new national requirements outlined in the federal Government's Quality Schools, Quality Outcomes strategy (2016). We understand the strategy document still requires full Education Council approval in order to be enacted so the status of some initiatives is unclear. 

Pedagogy and curriculum
\begin{itemize}
 \item Require teachers to use explicit literacy and numeracy instruction in schools
 \item Assess children in reading, phonics and numeracy during Year 1
 \item Require a minimum standard of literacy and numeracy from all students completing Year 12
 \item Require successful completion of an English or humanities subject and a maths or a science subject as a pre-requisite for students to get an ATAR
 \end{itemize}

Workforce
\begin{itemize}
 \item Mandate literacy/numeracy as a specialisation for primary teacher training
 \item Require graduate teachers to achieve registration at the Proficient level within three years of teaching
 \item Publish employment data against each level of the professional standards on My School 
 \item Set recruitment targets for STEM-qualified teachers and Indigenous teachers
 \item Find ways to improve the supply of competent language teachers
 \item Establish incentives to attract and retain experienced school leaders in disadvantaged schools
  \item Recognise high-performing teachers and reward them with increased pay
 \item Certify all new principals through a new national certification process
 \end{itemize}

Other accountability measures 
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Report annually to parents against agreed national literacy and numeracy standards
 \item Meet attendance targets, including specific targets for Indigenous students
 \item Systems that receive additional funding for disadvantage in areas such as Indigenous, low English, disability and low SES must show how the money will be used to improve outcomes 
 \item Indexation of Commonwealth funding contingent on meeting the outlined reform commitments\par
